# Musicwithtap
A very small Js project to change music with a tap
#It is more like an audio player where you can select and play the music of your choice and change accordingly

#Please add some songs in the folder name songs
#make sure the name of the audio files on the folder and index.js matches
#
Note: abc.mp3, def.mp3 etc .... are the name of the audio files enlisted in the audio player. (Here only 6 songs are added 
as a prototype)
